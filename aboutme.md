Our founder, Gabon Williams, is from Charlotte NC and went to Johnson C Smith University (JCSU) where he was a basketball playing student athlete who majored in Computer Engineering with a minor in mathematics. While at JCSU, he began to volunteer and lead a non profit in the inner city community with a focus on feeding the underserved community. After JCSU, he worked at fedex lugging boxes as a package handler until he began furthering his education at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a focus in Cybersecurity. He wanted to further his education in order to give back to others in his community struggling to get jobs after graduating college. The passion Gabon has for information security has allowed him to move into application security and penetration testing space.

This company serves to coach others and lead them down a path that not only enhances their long term wealth generation but also provides them with skills to protect themselves in the digital world. We have developed a cybersecurity coaching program for those looking to pivot into the field or for those looking to learn more about the space. In addition, our company is building out a cryptocurrency trading program to help others learn how to accrue wealth with limited resources over time.
